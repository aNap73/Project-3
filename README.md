# ^TITLE^

 ^TITLE^ is a fun, fast paced game, strategy roguelike and web community. Each player will have a character with a specified class. There will be only one character per user, and if that character dies in the game, the user must make a new character. Teams of 4 will have to wade through enemies in 5 rooms, and the 5th room will have a boss. Characters will obtain loot and be persistent through runs of dungeons.

 It will utilize a React View, with Node Express controllers and a Model using both a MySql and Mongo backend.
